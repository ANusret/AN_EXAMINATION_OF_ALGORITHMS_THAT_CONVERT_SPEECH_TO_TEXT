# AN EXAMINATION OF ALGORITHMS THAT CONVERT SPEECH TO TEXT

## Overview

Rapid technological advancements globally, particularly in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and speech recognition, have spurred notable progress. This evolution has accelerated the adoption of speech-to-text conversion technologies in various domains, presenting diverse applications within our developing nation. From healthcare systems to automotive interfaces, security setups, and beyond, speech-to-text technology has demonstrated its versatility.

In healthcare, the recording and management of patient data have been significantly enhanced through speech-to-text technologies. Professionals now utilize speech-based systems, introducing a personalized dimension to patient care. Similarly, the automotive industry leverages speech recognition for improved driver assistance systems and in-vehicle controls, elevating the overall driving experience.

AI-driven speech recognition algorithms, trained on extensive datasets, elevate natural language processing capabilities, enabling smoother and more natural interactions. These advancements provide our country with opportunities to optimize efficiency across sectors. Artificial intelligence, deep learning, and speech-to-text technologies emerge as indispensable tools, with datasets like Kaggle speech recognition playing a pivotal role in algorithm training.

The use of artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques in speech-to-text conversion, particularly through algorithms like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), has evolved. Variations such as LSTM 200 and LSTM 300 contribute to increased model complexity, facilitating a more effective understanding of speech data. Bidirectional algorithms, processing speech data both forward and backward, provide comprehensive contextual understanding.

The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) algorithm, another pivotal deep learning method, plays a crucial role in speech-to-text recognition models. GRU offers an advanced structure for updating memory cells, resulting in more efficient processing of speech data.

Collectively, these techniques contribute to enhancing the accuracy, speed, and efficiency of speech-to-text applications in our country, fostering accelerated developments in AI-supported speech recognition.

## Aim

The aim of this research is to comprehensively examine speech-to-text conversion algorithms, evaluating the applications of artificial intelligence-supported speech recognition technologies across various sectors. Specifically, the study seeks to investigate the impact of deep learning algorithms such as LSTM and GRU on speech recognition models, aiming to understand the potential of enhancing the utilization of these technologies in our country. The research aims to provide insights into how speech recognition applications can be employed more efficiently and effectively, particularly in critical areas such as the healthcare sector and automotive industry.

# Dataset Summary

The dataset employed in this study is derived from TensorFlow, presenting an open-source and freely accessible Speech Recognition dataset tailored for academic and research pursuits. This dataset comprises a rich collection of recordings featuring diverse individuals vocalizing 30 distinct texts, each accompanied by corresponding labels. The recordings are stored in .wav format, typically containing one sentence or a subsection of text read aloud, spanning durations from 1 to 10 seconds. The labels correspond to transcriptions of the spoken words in the recordings. With thousands of recordings and their respective labels, the dataset encompasses a wide array of speech samples, ensuring a comprehensive representation of various speakers. This diversity enhances the dataset's suitability for both research and academic exploration.

Moreover, in the landscape dominated by screens, the rise of voice interfaces offers a potential remedy. TensorFlow's Speech Commands Datasets, released to the public, contributes to this transformation. Featuring 65,000 one-second utterances of 30 short words by numerous individuals, this dataset facilitates the development of speech detection models. In this competition, participants are tasked with leveraging the Speech Commands Dataset to create algorithms adept at understanding simple spoken commands. Enhancing the accuracy of voice interface tools through open-sourced datasets promises to elevate product effectiveness and accessibility.
